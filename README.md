About the project

To understand the mechanic basis of actin filaments treadmilling in filopodia, this work presents an 
alternative stochastic model formulation to simulate molecule displacement. Unlike previous attempts, 
it considers not only diffusion as the essential transport mode, but adds cytoplasmic flow towards 
the tip (occurring to replace volume taken out by the back-flowing actin filaments), but also the 
specific properties and affinities of actin regulators, in particular, profilin and Ena/VASP. 
Integrated implementation of these physical and biochemical parameters into one computational model 
was possible by using particle-centered simulations, with object-oriented programming as a strategy
to model biological entities. An approach that seems to be unprecedented in biological modeling. 
When applying this particle-centered model, filopodia grow up to about 40 Î¼m in length, subfilopodial 
flow dynamics can be deduced, and it allows to test how the different parameters contribute to filopodial 
dynamics. Also, it has the capacity to be refined by gradually adding more or improved parameters 
obtained from biological or physical studies, thus serving as an iterative medium of prediction and 
validation. The particle-centered model developed here clearly demonstrates the potential of this strategy 
for the wider application to biological problems.
